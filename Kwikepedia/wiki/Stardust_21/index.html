                    <p>Stardust 21 is a manned space mission organized by the <a href="#">Equestrian Aerospace and Space Administration (EASA)</a> in coordination with other space agencies (such as <a href="#">KIRA</a>), primarily focused on the maintenance and upgrade of the <a href="#">MIDST (Massive Infrared Deep Space Telescope)</a>, the largest space telescope deployed by EASA, as well as additional scientific research activities.</p>

                    <h2 class="content-headings">Mission Overview</h2>
                    <p>Scheduled for launch on April 22, 2045, from the <a href="#">Jetstream Space Launch Centre</a>, Stardust 21 represents a major milestone in Equestrian interplanetary missions. The mission will last approximately 2 months and will focus on servicing and refitting the MIDST telescope, critical for deep-space imaging and astronomical research.</p>
                    <p>MIDST’s orbit, located at the second <a href="#">Lagrange point (L2)</a>, is known to be unstable and requires ongoing fuel consumption to maintain. Although fuel usage has been lower than expected, MIDST is approaching the end of its projected operational life, having been launched over 20 years ago. Instead of commissioning a new infrared telescope, EASA has chosen to extend MIDST’s capabilities with the Stardust 21 mission, which will also serve as a preliminary trial for future Mars missions, including <a href="#">Bifrost 1</a>, slated for launch two years after Stardust 21.</p>
                    <p>The mission has been initially met with doubt by observers as MIDST was never planned to be serviced by astronauts and therefore is not designed as much, adding to the difficulty of the mission. EASA has justified its existence by the reduced cost over the launch of a new telescope as well as using this mission as opportunity to test new methods and instruments in preparation of the <a href="#">Bifrost program</a>.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, Stardust 21 will be utilizing an advanced version of the <a href="#">Stardust</a> spacecraft, initially designed for reusable lunar missions. Although the spacecraft is over 15 years old, its robust design allows for extended missions beyond its initial scope, pushing the limits of its engineering and performance capabilities.</p>

                    <h2 class="content-headings">Crew Members</h2>
                    <p>The Stardust 21 crew consists of five selected astronauts, each with specialized training to ensure successful mission outcomes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong><a href="../Rosetta_(astronaut)/">Rosetta</a></strong> (Captain, EASA) - The mission leader overseeing MIDST operations and ensuring mission success, Rosetta is responsible for leading and coordinating the team.</li>
                        <li><strong><a href="../Concorde_(astronaut)/">Concorde</a></strong> (Pilot, EASA) - The mission’s skilled pilot, Concorde manages navigation, positioning the spacecraft for optimal access to the MIDST telescope.</li>
                        <li><strong><a href="../Aurora_(astronaut)/">Aurora</a></strong> (Engineer, KIRA) - Responsible for maintaining and repairing the telescope’s systems, Aurora is tasked with the detailed refit and equipment upgrades for MIDST.</li>
                        <li><strong><a href="../Zambuko_(astronaut)/">Zambuko</a></strong> (Biologist, ZSA) - Conducting biological research related to the mission’s long-duration space travel, Zambuko performs experiments on cellular and microbial adaptation.</li>
                        <li><strong><a href="../Wolfram/">Wolfram</a></strong> (Medical Expert, GSA) - The mission’s doctor, Wolfram monitors crew health, studying the physiological effects of prolonged space exposure, and providing in-flight medical care as needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The crew has an average age of 33, making it the youngest crew for an Equestrian deep-space mission, reflecting a shift towards a new generation of space explorers.</p>

                    <h2 class="content-headings">Launch Site</h2>
                    <p>The mission will launch from the Jetstream Space Launch Centre in Trottingham, Equestria, located on the eastern coast of the Shetland Islands. Known for its advanced launch capabilities, the center provides critical support for deep-space mission trajectories.</p>

                    <h2 class="content-headings">Objectives</h2>
                    <p>The objectives of the Stardust 21 mission include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To conduct extensive repairs and upgrades to the MIDST telescope, enhancing its imaging capabilities and extending its operational life</li>
                        <li>To perform essential maintenance tasks on MIDST’s solar array and communications systems</li>
                        <li>To carry out biological research on microbial resilience and cellular adaptation to space conditions</li>
                        <li>To collect data on the physical and psychological effects of prolonged space travel on the crew</li>
                    </ul>
